Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853). This repo is my personal take at the Sunshine app. Tags will try to highlight milestones along the course.

For the original version, please go [here](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine).

A changelog for the course can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/knowlabs.com/document/d/193xJb_OpcNCqgquMhxPrMh05IEYFXQqt0S6-6YK8gBw/pub).
